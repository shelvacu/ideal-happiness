    * Trish stands in scene, idling

    * Robot stands in scene, idling

    Trish: Hopeless! There's no way we can stop this asteroid from striking Earth!

    Robot: *Inquisitive beeping*

    Trish: No, Robot, a nuclear explosion would just shatter it.

    Trish: Without a way to destroy the asteroid, we're doomed.

    Robot: *Contemplative beeping*

    Trish: No, no, we couldn't divert its path this close.

    Robot: *Pensive beeping*

    Trish: As cool as that would be, I have never seen a bubble blower that large.

    Robot: *Concerned beeping*

    Trish: Impact in fifteen minutes.

    Robot: *Acquiescent beeping*

    Trish: It was good knowing you to, Robot.

    * Portal opens in scene

    * Time machine prop falls out of portal

    * Blue print prop falls out of portal

    * Portal closes

    Trish: What's this!?

    Robot: *Suspicious beeping*

    * Trish walks to props

    * Props dissapear

    Trish: It appears to be a handheld time machine and blueprints for an anti-matter bomb that will completely destroy the asteroid!

    Robot: *Excited beeping*

    Trish: Quick, Robot. We need to go acquire: Nuclear Control Rod, Annihilium, Anti-Matter, and Deus Ex Mechanism.

    Robot: *Exhortative beeping*

    Trish: Ah, you are right. We should probably travel back a few years to buy some time.

    * Portal opens

    * Trish and Robot exit through portal

[ Chapter 1: Nuclear Control Rod ]

(Picture) Destroyed Nuclear Power Plant

    Trish: This nuclear power plant was abandoned after a meltdown.

    Trish: We've travelled back just in time to nab a Nuclear Control Rod!

    Trish: It's too dangerous in there for me, but you won't be bothered by the radiation.

    Trish: I'm counting on you, Robot.

    Robot: *Understanding beeping*

    Trish: The salvage team will be here in a few hours, so let's hurry along.

    Trish: It's going to be difficult to navigate in there.

    Trish: I'll help you by using the time machine.

    Robot: *Determined beeping*
